**Current Setup:**
- FastAPI with SQLAlchemy ORM
- User registration/login endpoints
- Basic JWT token generation

**Requirements:**
- Access tokens with short expiry (15 minutes)
- Refresh tokens with longer expiry (7 days)
- Secure token storage and rotation
- Proper error handling for expired tokens
- Integration with FastAPI's dependency injection

**Specific Questions:**
1. How to structure the token refresh endpoint?
2. Best practices for storing refresh tokens securely?
3. How to handle token blacklisting after logout?
4. Proper middleware setup for automatic token validation?

I've seen various approaches but need a production-ready solution that follows security best practices.""",
