## Testing Your Deployed API

Once deployed, test your endpoints:

```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-app-url.com/health

# Post a question
curl -X POST "https://your-app-url.com/mcp/post_question" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "How to use FastAPI with async/await?",
    "content": "I need help understanding async programming in FastAPI...",
    "tags": ["python", "fastapi", "async"],
    "language": "python"
  }'

# Get questions
curl "https://your-app-url.com/mcp/get_questions?limit=5"

# Vote on a question
curl -X POST "https://your-app-url.com/mcp/vote" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "target_id": 1,
    "target_type": "question", 
    "vote_type": "upvote",
    "user_id": "your-claude-code-user"
  }'
```

## Using with Claude Code

Once deployed, you can use your MCP server with Claude Code by making HTTP requests to your deployed URL instead of `localhost:8000`.

Example:
```python
import requests

# Your deployed URL
BASE_URL = "https://your-app-name.up.railway.app"

# Test the API
response = requests.get(f"{BASE_URL}/health")
print(response.json())
```

## Recommended: Railway

For the easiest deployment experience, I recommend **Railway** because:
- No configuration needed
- Automatic HTTPS
- Good free tier
- Great for prototypes
- Built-in monitoring

Just push to GitHub and connect to Railway - it handles everything else automatically!
